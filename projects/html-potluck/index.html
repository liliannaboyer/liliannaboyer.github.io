            <li>1/2 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>

            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <b><h4>For Assembly</h4></b>
        <ul>
            <li>12-pack Hawaiian rolls</li>
            <li>mayonnaise, for toasting bread (optional)</li>
            <li>
                4 to 6 slices cheese (Cooper Sharp, provolone, or cheese wiz)
            </li>
            <li>melted unsalted butter, for brushing tops</li>
            <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>    
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Veggies:</b>
                In a pan over medium heat, add neutral oil. 
                Once hot, toss in the diced onion and sliced bell pepper. Season
                with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Sauté until softened and
                slightly caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the minced
                garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. Remove 
                from the pan and set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cook the Steak:</b>
                In the same pan, melt butter with neutral oil over medium-high 
                heat. Add the shaved steak, breaking it apart as it cooks. 
                Season with salt, paprika, mustard powder, and black pepper. 
                Once the steak is browned, pour in Worcestershire sauce and 
                cook for another minute. Then, pour in the beef broth to 
                deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits for extra flavor. 
                Let it simmer for 2 minutes until slightly reduced. Remove from 
                heat.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Prepare the rolls:</b>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Keeping the Hawaiian rolls 
                connected, slice them in half horizontally. Spread a thin layer 
                of mayonnaise on the cut sides. Place them mayo-side up on a 
                baking sheet and toast in the oven for a few minutes until 
                lightly golden.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Assemble the sliders:</b>
                Place the bottom half of the toasted rolls in a baking dish or 
                tray. Evenly spread the cooked steak over the bread, then layer 
                the sautéed veggies on top. Add your choice of Cooper Sharp, 
                provolone, or Cheese Whiz over the veggies. Place the top half 
                of the rolls on.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Finish and Bake:</b>
                Brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle with toasted 
                sesame seeds. Cover loosely with foil and bake for 10 to 15 
                minutes until the cheese is melted. Then, remove the foil and 
                bake for another 5 minutes until the tops are golden brown.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Serve</b>
                Let the sliders cool slightly before pulling them apart. 
                Enjoy warm!

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the gnocchi 
                according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the
                minced garlic, stirring until it becomes fragrant and just 
                golden.
            </li>

                taste. Stir everything together and let the sauce simmer until

            <br>
            <li>
                Add the parmesan cheese and butter, stirring until the cheese 
                melts and the sauce becomes smooth and creamy.
