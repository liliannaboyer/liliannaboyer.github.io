                <h1>Merliah Summers</h1>

                <p>
                    In Oceana, the residents were celebrating Merliah's 
                    one-year anniversary of her arrival to Oceana. In the 
                    human world, with support from Break, Hadley, and Fallon, 
                    Merliah was competing in the annual Surfing Invitational 
                    at Laguna Beach. Merliah and her biggest surfing rival, 
                    Kylie Morgan from Australia, were very competitive with 
                    each other.

                    In the competition, Fallon came in third place, Kylie was 
                    second, and Merliah was first. The next part of the 
                    competition would have Kylie, Merliah, Fallon and their 
                    friends going to the World Championship Surfing 
                    Invitational in Australia. Snouts came to see Merliah, 
                    so she went with him to tell her mother about the surf meet.

                <h3>Mermaid Disguise</h3>
                <p>
                    When trying to be a mermaid, she has to look like one. She 
                    wears a pink bikini top with seashells on them and a fake 
                    mermaid tail with the colors deep purple and sky-blue. The 
                    tail has moon and star designs on them.
                </p>

                <h3>Wavecrest Model</h3>
                <p>
                    In Australia, Merliah is picked to be the new model in 
                    Wavecrest Surf Gear, which she accepts. Her bikini is 
                    similar to the first movie, but the details on the top 
                    are different. She was forced to remove her necklace and 
                    wear a different one that Georgie Majors gave to her. Her 
                    hairstyle is changed, as well.

                <h3>Merliahs friend Snouts</h3>
                <img
                    src="images/merliah-3.png"
                    width="370px"
                    alt="seal with girl in ocean"

                    Snouts is very easily excited because when he saw Zuma, 
                    he swam towards her and licked her all over. He also 
                    knows quite a bit about fashion because when Merliah 
                    Summers was getting her mermaid makeover, he looked 
                    over at Zuma and then shook his head when he didn't 
                    like her outfit. Snouts is also very caring towards 
                    Merliah because when she was getting the Celestial Comb, 
                    he winced whenever she was having trouble climbing the 
                    amethyst rocks.
