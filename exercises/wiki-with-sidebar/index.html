                <p>
                    The name "Dr. Pepper" was first used commercially in 1885. 
                    It preceded the introduction of Coca-Cola by one year. 
                    Dr Pepper was introduced nationally at the 1904 Louisiana 
                    Purchase Exposition. It was formulated by Brooklyn-born 
                    pharmacist Charles Alderton in Morrison's Old Corner Drug 
                    Store in Waco, Texas. To test his new drink, he first 
                    offered it to store owner Wade Morrison, who also found it 
                    to his liking. Patrons at Morrison's soda fountain soon 
                    learned of Alderton's new drink and began ordering a "Waco". 
                    Alderton gave the formula to Morrison, who named it Dr. 
                    Pepper (later stylized as "Dr Pepper").Early advertisements 
                    for this soft drink made medical claims, stating that it 
                    "aids digestion and restores vim, vigor, and vitality."As 
                    with the formula for Coca-Cola, the formula for Dr Pepper 
                    is a trade secret, and allegedly the recipe is kept as two 
                    halves in safe deposit boxes in two separate Dallas banks. 
                    A persistent rumor since the 1930s is that the drink 
                    contains prune juice, but the official Dr Pepper 
                    FAQ refutes this with "Dr Pepper is a unique blend 
                    of natural and artificial flavors; it does not 
                    contain prune juice." The origin of the rumor 
                    is unknown; some believe it was started by a deliveryman 
                    for a competitor trying to cast aspersions based on prune 
                    juice's laxative effects, but it may simply be because 
                    many people feel that Dr Pepper tastes similar to prune 
                    juice.

                <p>
                    Dr Pepper is a bold and complex soft drink known for its 
                    unique blend of 23 flavors. Each sip delivers a harmonious 
                    fusion of sweet, spicy, and fruity notes, with hints of 
                    cherry, licorice, vanilla, and cola standing out the most. 
                    There's a subtle touch of amaretto and caramel that gives it 
                    depth, while undertones of prune and molasses add richness. 
                    The result is a smooth, layered flavor that’s unlike any 
                    other soda—both refreshing and intriguing, with just the 
                    right balance of tang and sweetness to keep you coming 
                    back for more.

                <p>
                    Dr Pepper’s future flavor endeavors promise to push 
                    boundaries while honoring its iconic 23-flavor legacy. 
                    As taste trends evolve, the brand is likely to experiment 
                    with bold fusions like spiced fruit infusions, 
                    dessert-inspired twists, and limited-edition 
                    collaborations that surprise and delight fans. 
                    Think creamy cinnamon vanilla, blackberry hibiscus, 
                    or even smoky cherry bourbon—all while maintaining 
                    that unmistakable Dr Pepper signature. With a loyal 
                    following and an appetite for innovation, Dr Pepper’s 
                    future flavors will continue to blur the lines between 
                    nostalgic comfort and adventurous refreshment, offering 
                    something unexpected in every new release.

                   In 1963, singer Donna Loren became a spokesperson for the 
                   company when she was selected in a nationwide search to be 
                   the "Dr Pepper Girl".[78][79] National exposure followed for 
                   Loren as she promoted the drink via radio, print, television, 
                   calendars, billboards, and personal appearances. One of her 
                   first appearances for the company was as co-host with Dick 
                   Clark (whom she worked with regularly) of an ABC television 
                   special, Dr Pepper Celebrity Party.

                <p>
                   Donna Loren subsequently made hundreds of singing and 
                   personal appearances for Dr Pepper. In Dr Pepper—King of 
                   Beverages, Dr Pepper historian Harry E. Ellis wrote, 
                   "Sparkly, vivacious and gifted with a wonderful voice, 
                   Donna was an immediate success. She became widely known 
                   in a short period as "The Dr Pepper Girl", appearing at 
                   special events and on programs sponsored by the company.

                <p>
                    Loren's role as Dr Pepper spokesperson led to her first 
                    appearance in the American International Pictures' Beach 
                    Party film Muscle Beach Party. Loren later explained: 
                    "Dr Pepper was involved in that [the Beach Party movies] 
                    and actually placed me as product placement. And because I 
                    could sing, they gave me a duet with Dick Dale, and then it 
                    just went on from there."[84] From this, she went on to 
                    appear in three more Beach Party films. Away from the 
                    company, Loren was a familiar presence in the 1960s due to 
                    her many performances on television, films, and her records 
                    for Capitol, Reprise and other labels. She represented 
                    Dr Pepper until 1968.

                <p>
                    Presently, Keurig Dr Pepper relies on its own bottling 
                    group to bottle and distribute its products in more than 
                    30 US states and Canada.[58] Coca-Cola and Pepsi have 
                    essentially stopped bottling and distributing 
                    Cadbury-Schweppes products in favor of in-house 
                    alternatives, although regional exceptions can be 
                    found.
